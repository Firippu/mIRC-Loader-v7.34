Description;
	Only for version 7.34
	Applies a few memory patches and dummy registry keys, making the client perform as if it were officially registered, preventing nag dialogs and wait timers.

Notes;
	Since 7.34 is now an old version, this code probably wouldn't used as intended. However, it can still be used as a reference.
